# Vanilla AI Rebalance

This package contains a rework of the Vanilla AIs for the setting of the 2022 rebalance AI tournament.

Special thanks goes to:

- Crusader Pilaw ([Pilaw's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@crusaderpilaw)), for the general idea of aranging AIs into tiers
- Krarilotus ([Krarilotus' Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Krarilotus)), as his aggressive AIs were the basis for my AIC files

I also used their ideas for my castle designs:

- the Snake's Castle 1 was inspired by Krari's snake
- the Caliph's Castle 8 is a copy of Pilaw's castle, adapted to this rebalance setting
